Q-1. Introduction to Python and its Features (simple, high-level, interpreted language).

ans :- Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming
language, known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It was
created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

Features of Python :-

    1. Easy to Learn and Use :- Python's syntax is clear and closely resembles the English
        language, making it beginner-friendly.

    2. Interpreted Language :- Python code is executed line by line, which simplifies
        debugging and allows for quick testing of code snippets.

    3. Dynamically Typed :- Variables in Python do not require explicit type declarations.
        The type of a variable is determined at runtime.

    4. Object-Oriented :- Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP), enabling
        developers to create reusable code through classes and objects.
